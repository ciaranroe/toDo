# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

#here we create data
Task.create([
    {title: "Become uninsane", details: "well..." },
    {title: "Become one with teflon", details: "details..." },
    {title: "Make supper", details: "bread..." }
